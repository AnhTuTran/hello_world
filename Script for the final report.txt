4 Introduction

as you know, my name is Tu, 
My major is Computer Engineering and I am studying at HCMUT
and my internship position is hardware

5 Target 

So after the internship what can i archive, what is my target ?
Besides learning basic technical skills, i also need to improve my soft skills 
and get used to working in professtional environment

6 Plan 

Internship program lasts 9 weeks from June thirteenth to August twelfth.
The schedule on the screen shows that every week I have a task to finish
From the easy one to the difficult one

7 Activities and Status
From task number 1 to number 5, 
about Linux, SystemC, Video Codec, iVCP1 operation and TRF UT ENV , they are not really to difficult
But the last one TRF UT Verification, it took me lots of time to find bugs - errors in source code

8 Difficulties and Countermeasure
During the internship, i have encountered 3 big difficulties
Number one is SystemC, i know nothing about it 
Number two is Video codec and number three is TRF UT verification because i am lack of knowledge and experience 

Besides asking mentor for supporting, i also find more information on the Internet at home 
and exchange information to another intern


9 Communication Chart
in communication chart What role am i playing ?

With instructor
I am following the instructions, doing exercises, attending weekly review and writing weekly report
Instructor is providing document, lecturing, giving advices, correcting wrong information 

With other interns
i communicate With them to exchange information, divide tasks  


10 Results

Before the internship training
I am Lack of experience about Linux and debugging
Have no knowledge about video compression concept and SystemC
Do not know how to make a formal report or document
Never work in a real project before
